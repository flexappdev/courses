# 🧾 Lesson 52 — Evaluation, Benchmarking & Leaderboards (HELM, MMLU, MT-Bench)

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #52*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **evaluate, benchmark, and compare** AI models across standardized tasks using metrics and datasets — ensuring that model improvements are **measurable, reproducible, and meaningful**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Model evaluation and benchmarking** provide quantitative ways to measure an AI system’s reasoning, factuality, coding, and safety capabilities.
Modern LLMs (GPT-5, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, Mistral 7B, etc.) are ranked on open benchmarks like **HELM**, **MMLU**, and **MT-Bench** to assess performance across diverse domains.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                                             | Description                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Benchmark**                                       | A dataset + evaluation protocol used to score model performance.               |
| **HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)**   | End-to-end benchmark across 40+ real-world tasks (accuracy, bias, toxicity).   |
| **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** | 57-subject exam for reasoning, STEM, and humanities.                           |
| **MT-Bench**                                        | Dialogue-based benchmark scored by GPT-4 or humans on helpfulness & coherence. |
| **TruthfulQA**                                      | Measures factual accuracy and resistance to falsehoods.                        |
| **ARC & BIG-Bench**                                 | Academic reasoning and multi-task benchmarks.                                  |
| **Eval Harness**                                    | Framework for running custom evaluations locally.                              |
| **HumanEval**                                       | Coding benchmark testing function correctness.                                 |

## ⚙️ Example — Evaluate a Model on MMLU

```python
from lm_eval import evaluator
results = evaluator.simple_evaluate(
    model="hf-causal",
    model_args="pretrained=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
    tasks=["mmlu"],
    batch_size=4
)
print(results["results"]["mmlu"]["acc"])
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Custom GPT Benchmark

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

tasks = [
    "Explain why the sky is blue.",
    "Write a Python function to reverse a string.",
    "Summarize Hamlet in 3 sentences."
]

for t in tasks:
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": t}],
        temperature=0
    )
    print(f"Task: {t}\nAnswer: {res.choices[0].message.content}\n")
```

## 🧱 Common Benchmarks (2025 Snapshot)

| Benchmark       | Focus                             | Evaluated Models                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **MMLU-Pro**    | Reasoning & knowledge             | GPT-5, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5     |
| **MT-Bench v2** | Dialogue quality                  | ChatGPT, Mistral, LLaMA 3       |
| **HELM 2.0**    | Multi-axis fairness & bias        | Enterprise & research models    |
| **HumanEval+**  | Code generation & tests           | Codex, GPT-Engineer, StarCoder2 |
| **Arena Hard**  | Open-ended model vs model battles | GPT-5 vs Claude 3.5 vs Gemini 2 |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Create a **Mini Evaluation Harness**
**Steps:**

1. Pick 5 representative prompts (reasoning, math, coding, writing, ethics).
2. Run outputs from 2–3 models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 3, Mistral 7B).
3. Score manually (1–10) on accuracy, fluency, and helpfulness.
4. Aggregate into a JSON report and rank models.

**Expected Outcome:**
A simple, transparent leaderboard of LLM performance across your selected tasks.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How does MMLU differ from MT-Bench in evaluating reasoning versus conversational ability?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Evaluation and benchmarking are **AI’s quality assurance layer** — they turn subjective impressions into hard data, guiding model selection and iteration.
