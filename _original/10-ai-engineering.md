## Introduction to Version Control

	The backbone of collaborative AI development.

Version control tracks every change in a project’s codebase, allowing multiple contributors to work simultaneously without conflicts. It ensures that previous versions can be restored, experiments can be isolated, and project history remains transparent.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Version control tracks changes and enables collaboration.**
2. **Facilitates rollback and recovery of code.**
3. **Supports branching for experimentation.**
4. **Enables teamwork in distributed AI environments.**
5. **Ensures reproducibility in research and deployment.**

## Understanding Git Architecture

	How Git manages code history internally.

Git is a distributed version control system that stores snapshots of your project rather than full file versions. It uses commits, branches, and a local repository to track changes efficiently. Every developer has a complete project copy, enabling offline work and resilience.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Git stores code as snapshots, not sequential changes.**
2. **Commits record specific states of a project.**
3. **Each developer works from a complete local repository.**
4. **Branches isolate changes without affecting main code.**
5. **Distributed structure supports independent development.**

## Setting Up Git and GitHub

	Getting started with your development toolkit.

To begin, install Git and configure user credentials. Create a GitHub account to host repositories online. Connecting Git and GitHub enables remote synchronization, backup, and collaborative development through push and pull workflows.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Install Git and set up configuration with `git config`.**
2. **Create repositories locally and remotely.**
3. **Use SSH keys for secure GitHub access.**
4. **Push commits to GitHub for cloud storage.**
5. **Clone repositories to share work with teams.**

## Core Git Commands

	The essential toolkit for AI developers.

Mastering Git commands is key to productivity. Commands like `init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` form the foundation of version control workflows. Each command helps capture project evolution in a structured, traceable way.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **`git init` creates a new repository.**
2. **`git add` stages files for commit.**
3. **`git commit` records project snapshots.**
4. **`git push` uploads changes to GitHub.**
5. **`git pull` updates local code from remote.**

## Branching and Merging

	Managing multiple development paths with confidence.

Branches allow parallel development of features or experiments without disrupting main code. Once verified, branches can be merged back into the main branch. This workflow is essential in AI experimentation, where different models or parameters may be tested concurrently.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Branches isolate experimental changes.**
2. **`git branch` and `git checkout` manage branches.**
3. **Merging integrates features into the main codebase.**
4. **Conflict resolution ensures code integrity.**
5. **Facilitates collaborative AI model development.**

## Collaboration with GitHub

	Working seamlessly with teams around the world.

GitHub enables global collaboration through repositories, issues, and pull requests. Teams can review each other’s work, suggest changes, and maintain clean, versioned histories. GitHub also integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **GitHub hosts repositories for shared access.**
2. **Pull requests enable code review and feedback.**
3. **Issues track bugs, tasks, and enhancements.**
4. **Collaborators can fork and contribute safely.**
5. **Integrates with tools for continuous integration.**

## Handling Conflicts and Pull Requests

	Resolving code collisions with best practices.

When multiple developers edit the same file, merge conflicts can occur. Understanding how to resolve them through Git tools and GitHub’s interface ensures smooth collaboration. Pull requests streamline peer review and maintain code quality.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Conflicts occur when edits overlap.**
2. **Manual resolution ensures intended changes persist.**
3. **Pull requests merge approved updates safely.**
4. **Reviews enhance code consistency and quality.**
5. **Transparent workflows build project trust.**

## Using Git for AI Projects

	Managing experiments and reproducibility.

In AI, version control extends beyond code — to models, data, and experiments. Git tracks model configurations, dataset versions, and evaluation metrics. Combined with tools like DVC (Data Version Control), it ensures reproducible and auditable AI workflows.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Git tracks code, data, and model versions.**
2. **Branching supports experimental model variations.**
3. **Integrates with DVC for large datasets.**
4. **Improves collaboration across research teams.**
5. **Ensures reproducibility in machine learning pipelines.**

## Version Control Best Practices

	Coding discipline for scalable AI development.

Following best practices ensures efficient collaboration. Commit often with meaningful messages, use branches for features, and document workflows clearly. Good version control hygiene prevents confusion and accelerates project success.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Commit frequently with descriptive messages.**
2. **Use feature branches for clean development.**
3. **Document repository structures.**
4. **Avoid committing large datasets directly.**
5. **Review code through pull requests.**

## Continuous Integration with GitHub

	Automating testing and deployment.

Continuous Integration (CI) connects version control with automated testing. GitHub Actions can build, test, and deploy models automatically when changes are committed. This workflow enhances reliability and shortens release cycles in AI projects.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **CI automates testing and deployment.**
2. **GitHub Actions trigger workflows on commits.**
3. **Ensures stable, production-ready code.**
4. **Reduces human error in repetitive tasks.**
5. **Accelerates delivery in AI application pipelines.**
