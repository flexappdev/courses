# ‚öôÔ∏è Lesson 81 ‚Äî Model Optimization, Compression & Quantization

### *(Pruning, Distillation, Quantization, Hardware Acceleration)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 ‚Äî Skill #81*

---

## üéØ Objective

Learn how to **optimize AI models for speed, efficiency, and deployment** on edge devices, mobile platforms, or large-scale production systems ‚Äî without significant loss in accuracy.

This is key for **scalable AI** that runs efficiently anywhere: from GPUs in the cloud to CPUs in smartphones.

---

## üß© Definition

**Model Optimization** involves techniques that reduce model size, latency, and computational cost.
**Compression** minimizes memory footprint, while **quantization** reduces numerical precision for faster inference.

Together, they make AI **lighter, faster, and cheaper** to deploy.

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept                            | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model Pruning**                  | Removing redundant neurons, filters, or weights to shrink model size.                            |
| **Quantization**                   | Converting high-precision (FP32) weights to lower precision (e.g., INT8) for faster computation. |
| **Knowledge Distillation**         | Training a smaller ‚Äústudent‚Äù model to mimic a larger ‚Äúteacher‚Äù model.                            |
| **Weight Clustering**              | Grouping similar weights to reduce storage requirements.                                         |
| **Dynamic vs Static Quantization** | Dynamic quantizes at inference; static precomputes scale factors during training.                |
| **Mixed Precision Training**       | Combines FP16 + FP32 operations for efficiency on GPUs.                                          |
| **Hardware Acceleration**          | Leveraging optimized hardware (TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, Core ML, etc.).                           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example ‚Äî Quantization with PyTorch

```python
import torch
from torchvision import models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Apply dynamic quantization
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)

print("Model size reduced by ~60%")
torch.save(quantized_model.state_dict(), "resnet18_quantized.pth")
```

‚û° Reduces memory footprint and improves inference latency with minimal accuracy loss.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example ‚Äî Knowledge Distillation Flow

```mermaid

A[Teacher Model] --> B[Soft Predictions]
B --> C[Student Model Training]
C --> D[Smaller, Faster Model]
```

‚û° The smaller model learns from the teacher‚Äôs **probability distribution**, not just hard labels ‚Äî improving generalization.

**Goal:** Optimize and deploy a vision model for mobile inference.

**Steps:**

1. Train or load a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet).
2. Apply pruning and quantization with PyTorch or TFLite.
3. Benchmark inference time before and after.
4. Export to ONNX or Core ML format for mobile.

**Expected Outcome:**
A compressed, production-ready model running **2‚Äì4√ó faster** on limited hardware with minimal accuracy trade-offs.
