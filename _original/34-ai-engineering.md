# 🧱 Lesson 34 — Data Engineering for AI

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #34*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **collect, clean, transform, and pipeline data** efficiently — the foundation of every successful AI system.
A strong AI engineer must think like a **data engineer** to ensure models are trained on **reliable, high-quality data**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Data Engineering** is the process of designing and maintaining systems that **prepare data for machine learning**.
It focuses on data pipelines — automating the movement of data from raw sources to clean, ready-to-train datasets.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                        | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ETL / ELT Pipelines**        | Extract, Transform, Load — moving raw data to usable formats. |
| **Data Lakes**                 | Centralized storage for raw data (S3, BigQuery, Delta Lake).  |
| **Data Warehouses**            | Structured analytics systems (Snowflake, Redshift).           |
| **Batch vs Stream Processing** | Scheduled (batch) vs real-time (streaming) data handling.     |
| **Data Schema**                | Defines how data is structured and validated.                 |
| **Data Quality**               | Checking for nulls, duplicates, and anomalies.                |
| **Feature Store**              | Central repository of reusable ML features.                   |
| **Data Governance**            | Ensures compliance, lineage, and security.                    |

## ⚙️ Example — Simple ETL Pipeline

```python
import pandas as pd

# Extract
data = pd.read_csv("raw_sales.csv")

# Transform
data = data.dropna()
data["revenue"] = data["price"] * data["quantity"]

# Load
data.to_parquet("clean_sales.parquet", index=False)
print("✅ ETL pipeline complete!")
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Stream Data Processing with Kafka

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'ai-events',
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_deserializer=lambda x: json.loads(x.decode('utf-8'))
)

for msg in consumer:
    event = msg.value
    print("Received:", event)
```

## 🧱 Essential Tools & Frameworks

| Category           | Tools                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Pipelines**      | Airflow, Prefect, Dagster           |
| **Streaming**      | Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming       |
| **Storage**        | AWS S3, BigQuery, Snowflake         |
| **Transformation** | dbt, Pandas, PySpark                |
| **Feature Stores** | Feast, Tecton, Vertex Feature Store |
| **Validation**     | Great Expectations, Soda.io         |

---

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Mini Data Pipeline for AI Training**
**Steps:**

1. Extract data from an API (e.g., weather or stock data).
2. Clean and validate it using Pandas or Great Expectations.
3. Store the cleaned data in Parquet format.
4. Schedule pipeline with Airflow or Prefect.

**Expected Outcome:**
A repeatable, production-ready data pipeline that feeds clean data into your ML training scripts.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse and how each supports AI workflows.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Data engineering is the **plumbing of AI** — if your data is wrong, your model will fail.
Clean, reliable, and automated data pipelines are the backbone of scalable AI systems.
