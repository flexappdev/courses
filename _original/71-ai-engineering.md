# 🧠 Lesson 71 — Causal Inference & Counterfactual Reasoning

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #71*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand **cause-and-effect relationships** in data, going beyond correlation to answer *why* something happens — a cornerstone for explainable, safe, and actionable AI systems.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Causal Inference** is the process of identifying whether a variable *causes* another, not just correlates with it.
**Counterfactual reasoning** imagines *what would happen if things were different* — critical for fairness, policy modeling, and AI decision support.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                            | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Correlation vs. Causation**      | Correlation = co-occurrence; Causation = direct influence.               |
| **Causal Graph / DAG**             | Directed Acyclic Graph mapping cause–effect links between variables.     |
| **Confounders**                    | Hidden variables that affect both cause and effect.                      |
| **Intervention (`do()` calculus)** | Actively changing a variable to see its effect (from Pearl’s framework). |
| **Counterfactuals**                | “What if X had been different?” scenarios.                               |
| **Treatment & Control Groups**     | Core setup in causal studies (A/B tests).                                |
| **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** | Difference in outcomes caused by intervention.                           |
| **Instrumental Variables (IV)**    | Variables used to isolate causal effects when confounding exists.        |

## ⚙️ Example — Using `DoWhy` for Causal Analysis

```python
import dowhy
from dowhy import CausalModel
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("marketing.csv")
model = CausalModel(
    data=data,
    treatment="ad_spend",
    outcome="sales",
    common_causes=["season", "competitor_activity"]
)
identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()
causal_estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name="backdoor.linear_regression")
print(causal_estimate)
```

➡️ Determines whether increased ad spend *causes* higher sales, controlling for confounders.

---

## ⚙️ Example — Counterfactual Query

```python
causal_estimate.interpret(method_name="linear_regression")
cf = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, causal_estimate, method_name="placebo_treatment_refuter")
print(cf)
```

➡️ Tests “what if” variations to validate causal strength.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Perform a **Causal Analysis of Customer Retention**
**Steps:**

1. Load historical data (discounts, churn, satisfaction).
2. Build a DAG identifying confounders.
3. Estimate causal effect of “discount_offered” on “customer_retained.”
4. Generate counterfactual report: “What if we hadn’t offered the discount?”

**Expected Outcome:**
An interpretable model that quantifies real-world causal effects — guiding strategic decisions instead of relying on correlations.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Why is causal inference more reliable than correlation in evaluating marketing or healthcare interventions?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Causal inference turns data into **decisions with purpose**, not just predictions — enabling ethical, policy-driven, and interpretable AI.
