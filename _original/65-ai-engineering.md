# ⚙️ Lesson 65 — Model Optimization for Inference (ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO)

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #65*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **optimize AI models for real-time inference** using frameworks like **ONNX**, **TensorRT**, and **OpenVINO** — reducing latency, memory footprint, and cost without retraining.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Inference optimization** transforms trained models into high-performance formats that execute faster on CPUs, GPUs, and edge devices.
The goal is to **accelerate prediction time** while maintaining the same accuracy — critical for deploying LLMs, vision models, and real-time apps.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                                 | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** | A universal model format for interoperability between frameworks.    |
| **Graph Optimization**                  | Removes redundant operations and fuses layers for faster inference.  |
| **TensorRT (NVIDIA)**                   | GPU inference accelerator with quantization and layer fusion.        |
| **OpenVINO (Intel)**                    | CPU and edge acceleration via model optimization and quantization.   |
| **Model Conversion**                    | Exporting from PyTorch/TensorFlow to ONNX, then optimizing.          |
| **Batching**                            | Combining multiple inference requests to improve throughput.         |
| **Runtime Engine**                      | Specialized inference runtime (ONNXRuntime, TRT Engine, OV Runtime). |
| **Latency Profiling**                   | Measuring speed and throughput for optimization feedback.            |

## ⚙️ Example — Export Model to ONNX

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertModel

model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 16, dtype=torch.float32)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "bert.onnx",
    input_names=["input"], output_names=["output"], opset_version=17)
print("Model exported to ONNX format!")
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Optimize with ONNX Runtime

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

session = ort.InferenceSession("bert.onnx", providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])
inputs = {"input": dummy_input.numpy()}
output = session.run(None, inputs)
print("Inference completed:", output[0].shape)
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Using TensorRT for GPU Acceleration

```python
import tensorrt as trt

logger = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
builder = trt.Builder(logger)
network = builder.create_network(1)
parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, logger)

with open("bert.onnx", "rb") as f:
    parser.parse(f.read())
engine = builder.build_cuda_engine(network)
print("TensorRT engine created for optimized inference.")
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Optimize a **BERT or Vision Transformer model** for real-time API use
**Steps:**

1. Export to ONNX from PyTorch.
2. Run inference benchmark with ONNX Runtime.
3. Convert to TensorRT or OpenVINO and re-benchmark.
4. Measure latency (ms), throughput (req/s), and model size reduction.

**Expected Outcome:**
A model that runs **2–5× faster** with minimal accuracy loss, suitable for cloud APIs or on-device apps.

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Why does TensorRT outperform ONNX Runtime on GPUs, and when would you prefer ONNX over TensorRT?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Optimization tools like ONNX, TensorRT, and OpenVINO turn your models into **production-grade performers** — enabling instant inference, lower costs, and hardware portability.
