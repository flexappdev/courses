## Model Serving Architectures

	Designing APIs and inference pipelines.

Model serving architectures define how predictions are delivered to users. Common patterns include REST APIs, serverless endpoints, and batch inference systems. Choosing the right architecture depends on latency and scalability requirements.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **REST APIs enable real-time model interaction.**
2. **Batch inference for periodic predictions.**
3. **Serverless endpoints for on-demand scaling.**
4. **Streaming inference for continuous data flows.**
5. **Architecture design affects cost and latency.**
