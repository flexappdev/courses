## Setting Up and Accessing the API

	Getting started with the Claude ecosystem.

Accessing the Claude API requires an Anthropic account and API key. The API can be used directly via HTTPS requests or integrated through official SDKs for Python, JavaScript, and other languages.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Register at console.anthropic.com to obtain an API key.**
2. **Install the Anthropic SDK for easy integration.**
3. **Authenticate via environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.**
4. **Make requests using `/v1/messages` endpoint.**
5. **Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses.**

## Claude Message API Overview

	The central interface for communication with models.

The `messages` endpoint powers conversation-based interactions with Claude. Developers can pass structured input (system, user, assistant roles) and receive model-generated responses in various formats.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **`/v1/messages` endpoint handles all LLM communication.**
2. **Supports JSON input for structured interactions.**
3. **Handles text, tools, and file uploads.**
4. **Supports multi-turn, long-context conversations.**
5. **Outputs include content type and model metadata.**

## Prompt Design and Role Management

	Crafting structured, reliable prompts.

Claude uses structured input roles to guide conversation flow. System roles set global behavior, while user and assistant messages handle task-level exchanges. Clear role management ensures predictable results.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **System messages define overall assistant behavior.**
2. **User messages deliver queries or data.**
3. **Assistant messages represent model responses.**
4. **Structured roles reduce drift and bias.**
5. **Consistent formatting improves reasoning quality.**

## Context Window and Memory Capabilities

	Holding complex, multi-document context.

Claude’s extended context window allows processing and referencing long documents, codebases, or transcripts in one request. This makes it ideal for research assistants and document summarization tools.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Supports up to 200,000 tokens (≈ 500 pages).**
2. **Maintains context over multi-turn sessions.**
3. **Perfect for legal, academic, and enterprise data.**
4. **Reduces need for retrieval mid-session.**
5. **Enables reasoning across multiple knowledge domains.**

## Comparing Claude vs GPT Architectures

	Choosing the right LLM for your stack.

Claude and GPT differ in training data, reasoning style, and safety mechanisms. Understanding these distinctions helps developers select the most suitable model for their application.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Claude emphasizes safety and alignment; GPT focuses on generalization.**
2. **Claude handles longer context windows natively.**
3. **GPT excels in coding and structured reasoning.**
4. **Claude models tend to produce more cautious responses.**
5. **Both can be integrated through frameworks like LangChain.**
