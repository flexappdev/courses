## Object-Oriented Programming in Python

	Building intelligent software architectures.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows engineers to model real-world systems through classes and objects. In AI projects, OOP organizes models, preprocessors, and datasets as reusable components. Inheritance and encapsulation simplify complex workflows.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Classes structure code into logical components.**
2. **Objects represent data and behavior.**
3. **Encapsulation hides complexity from users.**
4. **Inheritance promotes code reuse and extension.**
5. **OOP enables scalable, modular AI systems.**
