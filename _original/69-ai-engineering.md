# ⚖️ Lesson 69 — AI Governance, Compliance & Model Auditing

### *(EU AI Act, ISO/IEC, SOC 2, Model Risk Management)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #69*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how to **govern, audit, and certify AI systems** according to international standards — ensuring your models comply with ethical, legal, and operational regulations such as the **EU AI Act**, **ISO/IEC**, and **SOC 2**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**AI Governance** provides the frameworks and controls needed to manage the **risk, accountability, and lifecycle** of AI systems.
It defines how models are **documented, monitored, audited, and approved** before deployment — especially in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and government.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Governance Framework**        | Policies and processes defining how AI is developed and managed.              |
| **Model Risk Management (MRM)** | Identifies, quantifies, and mitigates model-related risks.                    |
| **AI Auditing**                 | Evaluating model performance, bias, robustness, and explainability.           |
| **EU AI Act (2025)**            | Classifies AI systems by risk and mandates transparency and safety standards. |
| **ISO/IEC 42001**               | Global AI management standard for responsible AI systems.                     |
| **SOC 2 (AI Edition)**          | Trust and security certification covering AI systems and data handling.       |
| **Model Cards & Datasheets**    | Documentation templates for transparency and governance.                      |
| **Responsible Disclosure**      | Reporting vulnerabilities or unintended harms in deployed AI.                 |

C --> D[Compliance Review (AI Act/ISO)]
D --> E[Model Card + Approval]
E --> F[Deployment + Monitoring]
F --> G[Continuous Auditing + Retraining]
```

➡ Ensures traceability, accountability, and risk control at each stage.

## ⚙️ Example — Model Card Template (Simplified Markdown)

```markdown
# Model Card — Sentiment Classifier v1.2
**Date:** Oct 2025  
**Owner:** Mat Siems (AI Engineer)  
**Purpose:** Analyze user sentiment in reviews  

## Performance
- Accuracy: 92.4%
- Fairness: ±2.1% variance across gender  
- Bias tests: Passed (AIF360 metrics)

## Risks
- Possible misclassification on slang or sarcasm  
- Not suitable for medical/emotional diagnosis  

## Compliance
- GDPR Compliant ✅  
- EU AI Act Risk Level: Low  
- ISO/IEC 42001 Alignment: Yes  
```

## 🧱 Key Governance Frameworks (2025 Overview)

| Standard / Law                  | Scope  | Purpose                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **EU AI Act**                   | Europe | Risk-based classification & documentation.          |
| **ISO/IEC 42001**               | Global | Management system for responsible AI.               |
| **ISO/IEC 23894**               | Global | Risk management for AI systems.                     |
| **NIST AI RMF (US)**            | U.S.   | Voluntary AI Risk Management Framework.             |
| **SOC 2 (AI Systems)**          | Global | Security, availability, and confidentiality audits. |
| **AI Assurance Framework (UK)** | UK     | Ethics and accountability guidance.                 |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Create a **Model Governance Checklist & Audit Report** for an AI API
**Steps:**

1. Draft an AI governance policy for your app.
2. Generate a model card and bias/fairness report.
3. Simulate an audit using ISO/AI Act criteria.
4. Document corrective actions and model lineage.

**Expected Outcome:**
A reproducible AI governance toolkit that satisfies **EU AI Act & ISO/IEC** standards — ready for real-world audits.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How does the EU AI Act classify AI systems by risk level, and what documentation is required for each category?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

AI governance turns experimentation into **trusted innovation** — ensuring your systems are **safe, fair, compliant, and auditable** before they ever reach users.
