# 📈 Lesson 79 — Continuous Evaluation, Monitoring & Drift Detection

### *(MLOps, Model Drift, Performance Tracking, Real-Time Validation)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #79*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **continuously monitor AI models after deployment** — detecting **data drift, concept drift, and performance degradation** in real time to ensure consistent, reliable, and ethical outputs over time.

This is how AI systems stay **trustworthy in production**, not just in the lab.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Continuous Evaluation** means systematically testing deployed models against live data and benchmarks.
**Drift Detection** identifies changes in data patterns or relationships that degrade model accuracy.

Together, these form the foundation of **responsible, production-ready AI**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Drift**                  | Change in the statistical distribution of input features over time.       |
| **Concept Drift**               | Change in the relationship between inputs and outputs (e.g., new trends). |
| **Model Monitoring**            | Tracking predictions, latency, and reliability across environments.       |
| **Real-Time Validation**        | Comparing predictions to live ground truth or synthetic benchmarks.       |
| **Shadow Deployment**           | Running new models alongside old ones to compare live results safely.     |
| **Alerting & Thresholding**     | Triggering automatic retraining or human review when performance drops.   |
| **Model Registry & Versioning** | Managing different model versions and deployment metadata.                |
| **Ethical Monitoring**          | Watching for bias drift or fairness regressions over time.                |

## ⚙️ Example — Drift Detection with Evidently AI

```python
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metrics import DataDriftPreset

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=baseline_df, current_data=live_df)
report.show()
```

➡ Generates an interactive dashboard showing which features have drifted statistically.

## ⚙️ Example — MLOps Monitoring Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Training Data] --> B[Model Deployment]
B --> C[Monitoring System]
C --> D[Drift Detection]
D --> E[Alert / Retrain Trigger]
E --> F[Model Registry Update]
F --> B
```

➡ A continuous cycle ensures model accuracy and stability in production.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **model monitoring dashboard** for an image classifier.

**Steps:**

1. Log predictions and metadata to a monitoring tool (Evidently or W&B).
2. Compare live vs training data distributions weekly.
3. Set up alerts when drift exceeds 10%.
4. Automate retraining pipeline if drift persists.

**Expected Outcome:**
A fully automated **model observability workflow** — keeping your AI system reliable, explainable, and continuously improving.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How can you detect and mitigate concept drift in a deployed sentiment analysis model without halting production?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

AI systems don’t fail suddenly — they **decay silently**.
Continuous evaluation ensures your models stay **accurate, fair, and aligned** long after deployment.
