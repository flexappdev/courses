## Introduction to Web Frameworks for AI

	Bridging models and users through APIs.

Flask and FastAPI transform AI models into deployable applications. They provide the foundation for building RESTful APIs that accept user input, process it through a model, and return predictions instantly — all through lightweight, scalable Python code.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Web frameworks turn models into usable applications.**
2. **Enable RESTful communication between client and AI.**
3. **Support real-time model inference.**
4. **Flexible and lightweight for rapid prototyping.**
5. **Essential for deploying AI-as-a-Service.**

## Flask Basics and Structure

	The classic foundation for Python web applications.

Flask is a microframework known for simplicity and flexibility. It allows developers to define routes and functions easily. For AI, Flask provides a quick and intuitive way to expose models as HTTP endpoints that can receive input and return predictions.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Flask offers minimal, extensible architecture.**
2. **Routes handle HTTP requests via decorators.**
3. **Integrates with any AI or ML framework.**
4. **Easy to deploy locally or on cloud platforms.**
5. **Ideal for proof-of-concept AI apps.**

## FastAPI Overview and Advantages

	The next generation of high-performance AI deployment.

FastAPI combines speed, automatic documentation, and type validation. It’s built on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), making it faster and more efficient than traditional frameworks. It’s especially useful for real-time AI inference and API integrations.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **FastAPI is asynchronous and optimized for performance.**
2. **Automatic Swagger and ReDoc API documentation.**
3. **Supports type checking with Pydantic models.**
4. **Ideal for deploying AI at production scale.**
5. **Modern replacement for traditional Flask setups.**

## Setting Up API Endpoints

	Creating communication channels for AI models.

Endpoints define where requests are received and responses sent. Engineers can define endpoints like `/predict` to take input, pass it to the model, and return predictions. Both Flask and FastAPI make endpoint creation simple and efficient.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Endpoints connect client requests to model logic.**
2. **Flask uses `@app.route()` decorators for routes.**
3. **FastAPI uses `@app.get()` or `@app.post()` with async functions.**
4. **Endpoints handle both input and output formats.**
5. **Key for model inference and interactive applications.**

## Handling Requests and Responses

	Translating data into model-ready formats.

AI APIs must handle incoming data securely and efficiently. JSON is the standard request format, and frameworks automatically serialize and deserialize data, enabling seamless communication between clients and models.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **APIs accept JSON payloads from clients.**
2. **Input data is parsed and validated automatically.**
3. **Models process the data to produce results.**
4. **Responses are returned in standardized JSON.**
5. **Ensures smooth communication between systems.**

## Input Validation and Error Handling

	Keeping your APIs safe and reliable.

FastAPI provides built-in validation using Pydantic, while Flask can use Marshmallow or custom checks. Proper validation prevents runtime errors and ensures the API only processes valid, well-structured data.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Validation ensures correct data formats and values.**
2. **Prevents crashes from malformed requests.**
3. **Error handling improves reliability.**
4. **Use exceptions and status codes effectively.**
5. **Enhances API security and trustworthiness.**

## Model Deployment Workflow

	Serving your AI models as live APIs.

AI engineers can deploy models by loading serialized files (e.g., `.pkl` or `.pt`) within Flask or FastAPI apps. Endpoints handle requests, feed data into the model, and return results, turning the model into a real-time prediction service.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Load pre-trained models in the web app.**
2. **Expose prediction logic via API endpoints.**
3. **Support multiple models with modular code.**
4. **Enable asynchronous processing for large tasks.**
5. **Deploy locally, on Docker, or in the cloud.**

## Adding Swagger Documentation

	Improving usability and transparency for API consumers.

FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc. Flask developers can use tools like Flasgger. Documentation enhances collaboration and allows users to test endpoints directly from the browser.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Swagger provides real-time API documentation.**
2. **FastAPI generates docs automatically at `/docs`.**
3. **Interactive interface helps test API endpoints.**
4. **Improves clarity and reduces onboarding time.**
5. **Essential for enterprise-level AI API management.**

## Comparing Flask and FastAPI

	Choosing the right tool for your AI application.

Flask is simple, flexible, and widely used. FastAPI is faster, type-safe, and modern. AI engineers should choose based on project scale — Flask for simplicity, FastAPI for performance and large-scale APIs.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Flask is best for quick prototypes and smaller apps.**
2. **FastAPI suits performance-critical deployments.**
3. **FastAPI supports async I/O for real-time AI systems.**
4. **Flask’s ecosystem offers rich extensions.**
5. **Choose based on scalability and speed needs.**

## Best Practices for Production Deployment

	From local development to global users.

Deploying APIs securely and reliably involves containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and logging. Engineers should implement rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring to ensure smooth performance and security.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Use Docker and CI/CD for consistent deployment.**
2. **Add authentication for protected endpoints.**
3. **Implement logging and error tracking.**
4. **Scale horizontally using cloud orchestration.**
5. **Regularly test and update deployed APIs.**
