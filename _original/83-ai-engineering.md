# ⚡ Lesson 83 — AI Infrastructure & Hardware Acceleration

### *(GPU, TPU, ASICs, HPC, Inference Engines)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #83*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand the **hardware foundations that power modern AI** — from GPUs and TPUs to custom ASICs and inference accelerators — and learn how to select, scale, and optimize infrastructure for **training, fine-tuning, and inference** workloads.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**AI Infrastructure** encompasses the **compute, storage, and networking** systems that support AI pipelines.
**Hardware Acceleration** refers to specialized chips (like GPUs or TPUs) designed to speed up neural network computations far beyond general-purpose CPUs.

The right infrastructure = faster models, lower cost, and scalable AI systems.

## ⚙️ Example — GPU Training Optimization

```python
import torch

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = MyModel().to(device)

for data, labels in dataloader:
    data, labels = data.to(device), labels.to(device)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

➡ Moves data and computation to GPU for parallelized training and reduced runtime.
