# 🔄 Lesson 55 — Data Pipelines & ETL for AI Systems

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #55*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement **data pipelines (ETL/ELT)** — the backbone of every AI system — to efficiently **collect, clean, transform, and load** data for training, fine-tuning, or inference workflows.

---

## 🧩 Definition

A **data pipeline** automates the movement of data from sources (APIs, databases, sensors) through **processing stages** (cleaning, transformation, feature extraction) into a **destination** (data lake, vector DB, or ML model).
ETL = *Extract → Transform → Load*
ELT = *Extract → Load → Transform* (used with cloud data warehouses like BigQuery or Snowflake).

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                 | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extract**             | Collect data from APIs, files, web scrapers, or streams.            |
| **Transform**           | Clean, normalize, enrich, or aggregate data into ML-ready format.   |
| **Load**                | Store processed data in databases, cloud buckets, or ML frameworks. |
| **Batch vs Stream**     | Batch = scheduled processing; Stream = real-time updates.           |
| **Data Orchestration**  | Scheduling and dependency management (Airflow, Prefect).            |
| **Data Validation**     | Schema enforcement and quality checks.                              |
| **Feature Engineering** | Creating ML features from raw data.                                 |
| **Observability**       | Monitoring data flow, freshness, and errors.                        |

## ⚙️ Example — Simple ETL in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

# Extract
data = pd.read_csv("sales_raw.csv")

# Transform
data["date"] = pd.to_datetime(data["date"])
data["revenue"] = data["price"] * data["quantity"]
cleaned = data.dropna(subset=["customer_id", "revenue"])

# Load
cleaned.to_csv("sales_clean.csv", index=False)
print("ETL completed successfully!")
```

## ⚙️ Example — Airflow DAG for Automated Pipeline

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def extract(): ...
def transform(): ...
def load(): ...

with DAG("ai_data_pipeline", start_date=datetime(2025,1,1), schedule="@daily") as dag:
    t1 = PythonOperator(task_id="extract", python_callable=extract)
    t2 = PythonOperator(task_id="transform", python_callable=transform)
    t3 = PythonOperator(task_id="load", python_callable=load)
    t1 >> t2 >> t3
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Daily ETL Pipeline for Product Analytics**
**Steps:**

1. Extract data from an e-commerce API (sales, users, products).
2. Clean and transform using Pandas or PySpark.
3. Store in a local PostgreSQL or S3 bucket.
4. Schedule daily runs via Airflow or Prefect.

**Expected Outcome:**
A fully automated data pipeline that produces clean, structured data daily — ready for analytics or model training.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Why are ELT pipelines preferred for cloud-scale AI architectures?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

A well-designed data pipeline ensures your AI models are **fed reliable, timely, and clean data** — the single biggest factor in real-world model performance.
