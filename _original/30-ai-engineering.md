## Introduction to FastAPI for AI

	Serving AI intelligence through APIs.

FastAPI is a modern Python framework designed for building fast, async web APIs. It’s used to expose AI models as REST endpoints, allowing users and apps to send requests and get predictions in real time.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **FastAPI is built for async performance and scalability.**
2. **Ideal for serving ML and DL models as APIs.**
3. **Auto-generates interactive docs (Swagger, ReDoc).**
4. **Integrates easily with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.**
5. **Perfect for AI microservices and serverless applications.**

## Why FastAPI is Ideal for Model Serving

	Combining performance, simplicity, and developer experience.

FastAPI is built on **Starlette** and **Pydantic**, offering unmatched speed and type validation. Its asynchronous design enables it to handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently — critical for model inference APIs.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Built for high performance (async I/O).**
2. **Type safety and validation with Pydantic.**
3. **Easy integration with cloud and databases.**
4. **Generates OpenAPI-compliant documentation.**
5. **Outperforms Flask and Django for inference workloads.**

## Setting Up Your First API Project

	Creating the foundation for your AI endpoint.

Start by installing FastAPI and Uvicorn, the ASGI server that runs it. You’ll then define a simple route that returns predictions from your AI model.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn via pip.**
2. **Define main API file (e.g., `main.py`).**
3. **Run with `uvicorn main:app --reload`.**
4. **Access docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`.**
5. **Base setup takes under 5 minutes.**

## Defining API Routes and Endpoints

	Structuring how clients interact with your AI model.

Routes define the accessible endpoints of your API. Each route can handle GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE methods — typically, POST is used for sending input data to AI models.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Use `@app.post()` for prediction endpoints.**
2. **Organize routes in modules for scalability.**
3. **Define input/output data models using Pydantic.**
4. **Support multiple tasks and models under one app.**
5. **Ensure consistent endpoint naming and versioning.**

## Loading and Using AI Models

	Connecting your trained model to the API backend.

You can load models from frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn directly within FastAPI. Ensure models are loaded once at startup to reduce latency during inference.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Load models globally to avoid reloading per request.**
2. **Use `startup_event` to initialize heavy models.**
3. **Support multiple model formats (e.g., ONNX, Pickle).**
4. **Return model predictions in JSON responses.**
5. **Leverage GPU-accelerated inference if available.**

## Handling JSON and File Inputs

	Enabling flexible user interactions with your API.

FastAPI handles multiple input types, including text, JSON, and files. This flexibility is key for serving NLP, vision, or audio models.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Accept JSON inputs for text-based models.**
2. **Handle file uploads for image or audio inference.**
3. **Use `FormData` for hybrid requests.**
4. **Validate input fields using Pydantic schemas.**
5. **Ensure secure data parsing and sanitization.**

## Adding Async and Batch Processing

	Boosting performance and throughput.

Asynchronous processing lets your app handle multiple requests concurrently, while batch endpoints process multiple inputs at once for greater efficiency.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Use async functions for non-blocking I/O.**
2. **Batch process multiple predictions in one call.**
3. **Integrate task queues like Celery or Redis.**
4. **Improves latency under high traffic.**
5. **Essential for scaling inference workloads.**

## Integrating with Frontend and Databases

	Connecting your model API to user interfaces and storage.

FastAPI integrates seamlessly with frontend frameworks (React, Streamlit) and databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for full-stack AI applications.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Serve predictions directly to web UIs.**
2. **Log inferences to a database.**
3. **Use ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM.**
4. **Connect to dashboards or analytics tools.**
5. **Build complete AI-powered web applications.**

## Testing Logging and Error Handling

	Making your API robust and reliable.

Testing ensures your endpoints behave as expected under different conditions. Proper error handling and logging are critical for monitoring model performance and debugging.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Use `pytest` or FastAPI’s TestClient for testing.**
2. **Add structured error messages with HTTPException.**
3. **Use logging middleware for performance insights.**
4. **Include validation for malformed requests.**
5. **Monitor API health with tools like Prometheus or ELK stack.**

## Deploying FastAPI on the Cloud

	Scaling your AI API globally.

FastAPI apps can be deployed easily using cloud services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Run, or container orchestration with Kubernetes.

**Key Ideas:**
1. **Deploy with Docker for reproducibility.**
2. **Use Uvicorn + Gunicorn for production.**
3. **Serverless options (Lambda, Cloud Run) for lightweight inference.**
4. **Kubernetes for large-scale deployment.**
5. **Monitor uptime and latency post-deployment.**
