# ⚡ Lesson 62 — Distributed Training & Parallelization (Data, Model, Pipeline Parallel)

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #62*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **train massive AI models efficiently** across multiple GPUs, TPUs, or nodes by using **distributed training strategies** — essential for scaling large neural networks like GPT, Gemini, or Mistral.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Distributed training** splits a large model’s computation and data across multiple processors or machines to reduce training time and handle huge datasets.
There are three main strategies:

1. **Data Parallelism** — Split data batches.
2. **Model Parallelism** — Split model layers or parameters.
3. **Pipeline Parallelism** — Split training into sequential stages across devices.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                              | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Parallelism**                 | Each GPU trains on different data batches and syncs gradients. |
| **Model Parallelism**                | Model layers or weights are split across multiple GPUs.        |
| **Pipeline Parallelism**             | Training stages are distributed and executed concurrently.     |
| **Gradient Synchronization**         | Combining gradients from all workers to update weights.        |
| **AllReduce Operation**              | Aggregates gradients across GPUs efficiently.                  |
| **Mixed Precision Training**         | Uses float16 to save memory and accelerate training.           |
| **Elastic Training**                 | Dynamically scales number of workers (e.g., with DeepSpeed).   |
| **Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)** | Memory-efficient optimizer for multi-GPU models.               |

## ⚙️ Example — Data Parallel Training with PyTorch DDP

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

def setup(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def train(rank, world_size):
    setup(rank, world_size)
    model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1).to(rank)
    ddp_model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(ddp_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

    for _ in range(100):
        x = torch.randn(32, 10).to(rank)
        y = torch.randn(32, 1).to(rank)
        loss = loss_fn(ddp_model(x), y)
        optimizer.zero_grad(); loss.backward(); optimizer.step()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    torch.multiprocessing.spawn(train, args=(4,), nprocs=4)
```

➡️ Runs training on 4 GPUs with automatic gradient synchronization.

## ⚙️ Example — Using DeepSpeed for Large Model Training

```python
import deepspeed
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
engine, _, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(model=model, model_parameters=model.parameters())
engine.train()
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Train a **Mini-Language Model** on multiple GPUs
**Steps:**

1. Use a small GPT-2 model and dataset (WikiText-2).
2. Configure PyTorch DDP or DeepSpeed for distributed training.
3. Measure performance improvement vs single-GPU baseline.
4. Log throughput, memory usage, and convergence time.

**Expected Outcome:**
A hands-on understanding of parallelization gains, communication overheads, and scaling efficiency.

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain when to use data parallelism vs model parallelism when training large transformer models.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Distributed training is **the engine behind frontier AI models** — turning multi-day single-GPU jobs into efficient, scalable training pipelines across clusters.
