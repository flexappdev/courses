# ⚙️ Lesson 57 — Feature Engineering & Feature Stores

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #57*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **create, manage, and reuse features** — the measurable properties of data — that drive model performance.
Understand how **feature stores** help maintain consistency between training and inference, and how engineered features transform raw data into predictive insight.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Feature Engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into **useful inputs (features)** for machine learning models.
**Feature Stores** are centralized systems that manage these features — ensuring they’re available, consistent, and versioned across teams and environments.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                 | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature**             | Quantifiable variable used as model input (e.g., “average session time”). |
| **Feature Engineering** | Creating new features from existing data to improve predictions.          |
| **Feature Scaling**     | Normalizing data (standardization, min-max scaling).                      |
| **Encoding**            | Converting categorical values to numeric form (one-hot, label encoding).  |
| **Feature Drift**       | Distribution change of features between training and production.          |
| **Feature Store**       | Centralized system to register, retrieve, and monitor features.           |
| **Offline Store**       | Used during training (batch data).                                        |
| **Online Store**        | Low-latency serving during inference (real-time).                         |

## ⚙️ Example — Feature Engineering in Python

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

df = pd.read_csv("user_data.csv")

# Create new features
df["click_rate"] = df["clicks"] / (df["impressions"] + 1)
df["avg_session_time"] = df["session_duration"] / df["sessions"]

# Normalize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[["click_rate", "avg_session_time"]] = scaler.fit_transform(df[["click_rate", "avg_session_time"]])

print(df.head())
```

## ⚙️ Example — Registering Features in Feast (Open-Source Feature Store)

```python
from feast import Feature, Entity, FeatureView, Field
from feast.types import Float32, Int64

user = Entity(name="user_id")

user_features = FeatureView(
    name="user_profile",
    entities=[user],
    ttl=None,
    schema=[
        Field(name="avg_session_time", dtype=Float32),
        Field(name="click_rate", dtype=Float32),
        Field(name="num_purchases", dtype=Int64),
    ],
    online=True,
)
```

## 🧱 Feature Store Ecosystem

| Tool                         | Type        | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Feast**                    | Open-source | Google & Tecton-built feature store for ML. |
| **Tecton**                   | Enterprise  | Managed cloud feature store with pipelines. |
| **Hopsworks**                | Full-stack  | Feature + model registry integration.       |
| **Vertex AI Feature Store**  | Cloud       | Google Cloud-managed feature service.       |
| **Databricks Feature Store** | Cloud       | Integrated with Spark + MLflow pipelines.   |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Feature Engineering Pipeline for User Retention Prediction**
**Steps:**

1. Collect user behavior data (sessions, clicks, purchases).
2. Engineer features like engagement rate, time between logins, churn risk.
3. Store them in Feast as reusable features.
4. Use these features to train a churn-prediction model.

**Expected Outcome:**
A reproducible feature engineering and storage system that ensures training–inference consistency and accelerates ML experimentation.

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How do feature stores solve the training-serving skew problem in production ML pipelines?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Feature engineering turns **data into intelligence**, while feature stores make that intelligence **shareable, consistent, and production-ready**.
