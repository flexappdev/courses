# 🤖 Lesson 74 — Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

### *(RLHF, PPO, SAC, Actor–Critic, Reward Modeling)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #74*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how **deep neural networks** enhance classical reinforcement learning — creating powerful agents capable of solving **complex, high-dimensional tasks** like gaming, robotics, and human feedback alignment (RLHF).

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** combines **reinforcement learning** with **deep learning**, where neural networks approximate policies, value functions, or both.

This enables agents to handle **continuous states, visual inputs, and complex environments** — far beyond the tabular Q-learning scope.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                                               | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Policy Gradient Methods**                           | Optimize policies directly via gradient ascent on expected reward.      |
| **Actor–Critic Architecture**                         | The *actor* chooses actions; the *critic* evaluates them.               |
| **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**                | Stable and efficient policy gradient method used in ChatGPT & robotics. |
| **Soft Actor–Critic (SAC)**                           | Uses entropy regularization for better exploration.                     |
| **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**                              | Combines Q-learning with CNNs to handle pixel-based inputs.             |
| **Reward Modeling**                                   | Train neural networks to predict human preferences or goals.            |
| **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** | Aligns models using human preference data (used in GPT-4/5).            |
| **Curriculum Learning**                               | Gradually increases task difficulty for smoother learning.              |

## ⚙️ Example — PPO Training Loop (Simplified)

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000)
model.save("ppo_cartpole")
```

➡ Uses gradient-based policy optimization to maximize long-term reward.

---

## ⚙️ Example — RLHF Process Overview

A[Pretrained Model] --> B[Generate Responses]
B --> C[Human Labelers Rank Outputs]
C --> D[Train Reward Model]
D --> E[Fine-Tune Model via PPO]
E --> F[Aligned Model (Human Preference)]
```

➡ RLHF introduces **human judgment** into reinforcement learning — key for safe and aligned LLMs.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Implement PPO to train a self-learning trading agent.

**Steps:**

1. Simulate an environment (e.g., stock price data).
2. Define rewards based on portfolio returns.
3. Train an agent using PPO or SAC.
4. Plot cumulative rewards and analyze risk-adjusted performance.

**Expected Outcome:**
A DRL agent capable of learning dynamic trading strategies via continuous feedback loops.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Train a PPO agent on a continuous action-space environment (Pendulum-v1) and visualize learning curves and entropy decay.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Deep RL enables **AI that learns by doing** — combining perception (deep learning) and action (reinforcement learning) to achieve human-level performance in dynamic environments.
