# ☁️ Lesson 86 — Cloud AI & Serverless Architectures

### *(AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda, Vertex AI, Scalability-as-a-Service)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #86*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Master how to **build and deploy scalable AI systems in the cloud** using **serverless architectures** and managed AI services from **AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure** — minimizing infrastructure overhead while maximizing scalability and cost efficiency.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Cloud AI** means leveraging managed infrastructure, APIs, and GPU/TPU services for end-to-end ML development.
**Serverless AI** extends this by abstracting servers entirely — you deploy *functions*, not machines — scaling automatically based on demand.

The goal: **no ops, just AI.**

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                           | Description                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Serverless Computing**          | Code runs on-demand (no provisioning) — e.g., AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions.     |
| **Managed AI Services**           | Prebuilt services like SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Azure ML simplify deployment. |
| **Event-Driven ML**               | Triggers models automatically based on real-world or API events.               |
| **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing** | Cloud adjusts compute capacity dynamically as traffic fluctuates.              |
| **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid AI**       | Combine multiple providers for resilience and optimization.                    |
| **Data Residency & Governance**   | Keep data in compliance zones (GDPR, ISO).                                     |
| **Cost Optimization**             | Use spot instances, autoscaling, and on-demand pricing.                        |
| **Edge-to-Cloud Integration**     | Sync edge models with cloud AI via federated or incremental updates.           |

## ⚙️ Example — Serverless Inference with AWS Lambda

```python
import json
import joblib
import boto3

model = joblib.load("/opt/model.pkl")

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    features = event["features"]
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return {"statusCode": 200, "body": json.dumps({"prediction": int(prediction[0])})}
```

➡ Deploys a trained model as a **serverless endpoint** — scaling instantly with zero server management.

➡ A fully managed **cloud AI lifecycle** — continuous, scalable, and compliant.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **serverless image classification API** using Vertex AI and Cloud Run.

**Steps:**

1. Train or upload your model to Vertex AI.
2. Package inference code into a container.
3. Deploy via Cloud Run for auto-scaling.
4. Trigger predictions through HTTP events or Pub/Sub.
5. Add Cloud Monitoring for latency & usage metrics.

**Expected Outcome:**
A **scalable, cost-efficient cloud AI service** that auto-scales to zero when idle — pay only for what you use.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how to deploy a PyTorch model as a serverless function on AWS Lambda and connect it to an S3 data source.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

**Serverless AI = infinite scale, zero maintenance.**
Cloud-native tools let you focus on **building models**, not managing machines — the essence of modern AI engineering.
