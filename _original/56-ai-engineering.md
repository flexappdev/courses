# 🏷️ Lesson 56 — Data Labeling & Annotation Pipelines

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #56*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **label, annotate, and curate datasets** for supervised learning and fine-tuning — ensuring that your AI models learn from **high-quality, human-verified data**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Data labeling** is the process of assigning meaningful tags or categories to raw data (text, image, audio, video) so models can learn from it.
For example, tagging emails as *spam* or *not spam*, marking bounding boxes around cars, or labeling sentiment in tweets.
Modern pipelines combine **manual**, **programmatic**, and **AI-assisted** annotation to scale efficiently.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                             | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Annotation Task**                 | Type of labeling — classification, segmentation, sentiment, etc. |
| **Ground Truth**                    | Verified, human-approved labels used as reference.               |
| **Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)** | Consistency measure between multiple annotators.                 |
| **Active Learning**                 | Model selects uncertain samples for humans to label.             |
| **Weak Supervision**                | Automatic labeling using heuristics or rules.                    |
| **Label Quality Control**           | Verification and consensus checks to reduce bias/errors.         |
| **Data Versioning**                 | Tracking dataset changes (e.g., with DVC).                       |
| **Synthetic Labeling**              | Generating labels using LLMs or simulations.                     |

## ⚙️ Example — Simple Labeling Script (Text Classification)

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("tweets.csv")

def label_sentiment(text):
    if "love" in text.lower(): return "positive"
    elif "hate" in text.lower(): return "negative"
    else: return "neutral"

data["sentiment"] = data["text"].apply(label_sentiment)
data.to_csv("tweets_labeled.csv", index=False)
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Using an AI-Assisted Labeling Tool

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

def ai_label(text):
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Label sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral."},
                  {"role": "user", "content": text}]
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content.strip()

data["ai_label"] = data["text"].apply(ai_label)
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Text Sentiment Labeling Pipeline**
**Steps:**

1. Load a dataset of 1,000 social media posts.
2. Use GPT-based auto-labeling for initial sentiment tags.
3. Verify 10% of samples manually for accuracy.
4. Store results with version control using DVC or Git LFS.

**Expected Outcome:**
A hybrid AI-human labeling pipeline producing clean, reliable labeled data for training or fine-tuning sentiment models.

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How can active learning reduce labeling costs while improving dataset quality?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

High-quality labels are the **fuel of supervised learning** — every great AI model starts with consistent, clean, and well-annotated data.
