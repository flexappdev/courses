### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #67*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **reduce the environmental and financial footprint** of AI systems by optimizing computation, tracking carbon impact, and designing **sustainable machine learning pipelines**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Green AI** focuses on developing models and infrastructure that minimize energy use while maintaining performance.
With LLMs consuming megawatt-hours during training, efficiency and sustainability have become essential skills for modern AI engineers.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Energy Profiling**            | Measuring GPU/CPU power consumption during training and inference.         |
| **Carbon Footprint Estimation** | Quantifying emissions based on compute and location.                       |
| **Model Efficiency**            | Reducing parameters, FLOPs, and latency.                                   |
| **Hardware Utilization**        | Maximizing GPU usage while minimizing idle time.                           |
| **Mixed Precision Training**    | Using FP16/BF16 to reduce compute overhead.                                |
| **Efficient Architectures**     | Models designed for fewer FLOPs (e.g., DistilBERT, MobileNet, TinyViT).    |
| **Cloud Carbon Intensity**      | Varies by region — choosing green data centers lowers emissions.           |
| **Lifecycle Optimization**      | Considering efficiency across data prep, training, inference, and storage. |

## ⚙️ Example — Estimate CO₂ Emissions with CodeCarbon

```python
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

tracker = EmissionsTracker(project_name="bert_training")
tracker.start()

# Your training code here
# model.fit(train_data)

tracker.stop()
```

➡ Outputs total **CO₂e emissions**, **energy consumed (kWh)**, and **carbon intensity by region**.

---

## ⚙️ Example — Mixed Precision Training (PyTorch)

```python
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast

scaler = GradScaler()
for data, target in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    with autocast():
        output = model(data)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

➡ Uses half-precision floats (FP16/BF16) to reduce energy and memory cost by ~40%.

| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **DistilBERT**                  | NLP                 | 40% smaller, 60% faster, 97% as accurate as BERT.   |
| **MobileNet / EfficientNet**    | Vision              | Optimized convolution blocks (depthwise separable). |
| **TinyViT / ConvNeXt-T**        | Vision Transformers | Lightweight transformer hybrids.                    |
| **Phi-2 / Gemma / Mistral 7B**  | LLMs                | Small-scale LLMs optimized for efficiency.          |
| **Whisper Tiny / FastSpeech 2** | Audio               | Optimized inference pipelines.                      |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Benchmark and optimize a model for **energy efficiency and carbon footprint**
**Steps:**

1. Train a model (BERT or ResNet).
2. Track emissions using `codecarbon`.
3. Apply FP16 training, pruning, and smaller batch sizes.
4. Compare energy use and accuracy before vs. after optimization.

**Expected Outcome:**
A trained model with **30–50% lower energy consumption** and minimal accuracy loss, accompanied by a sustainability report.
