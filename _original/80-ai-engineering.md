# 🚀 Lesson 80 — Model Deployment, Scaling & Lifecycle Management

### *(CI/CD for ML, Containerization, Versioning, Scaling Inference, MLOps Pipelines)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #80*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **deploy, scale, and manage AI models in production** using modern MLOps tools and infrastructure — ensuring high availability, version control, and seamless model updates across environments.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Model Deployment** is the process of serving trained models as APIs or microservices.
**Lifecycle Management** ensures that models are tracked, updated, and monitored throughout their entire operational lifespan — from **training to retirement**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                       | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Containerization (Docker)** | Packages model code and dependencies into portable units.         |
| **Model Registry**            | Centralized store for model versions and metadata.                |
| **CI/CD for ML (MLOps)**      | Automated build–test–deploy pipeline for AI models.               |
| **Model Serving**             | Real-time or batch inference via REST, gRPC, or streaming.        |
| **A/B & Canary Deployment**   | Gradually test new model versions against production traffic.     |
| **Autoscaling**               | Dynamically adjust compute based on load (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.). |
| **Monitoring & Logging**      | Capture metrics like latency, throughput, and drift.              |
| **Rollback & Governance**     | Safely revert or retire underperforming models.                   |

## ⚙️ Example — FastAPI Model Deployment

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: dict):
    X = [data['feature1'], data['feature2']]
    prediction = model.predict([X])
    return {"prediction": prediction[0]}
```

➡ Deploys a machine learning model as a lightweight REST API endpoint.

---

## ⚙️ Example — ML Lifecycle Flow

```mermaid

A[Data Preparation] --> B[Model Training]
B --> C[Model Registry]
C --> D[Deployment (API / Batch)]
D --> E[Monitoring & Drift Detection]
E --> F[Retraining & Version Update]
F --> B
```

➡ A continuous **train → deploy → monitor → retrain** cycle underpins reliable MLOps systems.

| **Docker / Podman**                  | Containerization               | Portable and reproducible environments |
| **Kubernetes / ECS**                 | Orchestration & autoscaling    | Handles distributed workloads          |
| **MLflow**                           | Model tracking and deployment  | Standard open-source framework         |
| **Kubeflow / Vertex AI / SageMaker** | End-to-end MLOps platforms     | Cloud-native automation                |
| **FastAPI / Flask / BentoML**        | Lightweight model serving APIs | Python-friendly                        |
| **Airflow / Prefect**                | Workflow orchestration         | Automates pipelines                    |
| **Terraform / Helm**                 | Infrastructure as Code (IaC)   | Scalable infrastructure setup          |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Deploy a **Sentiment Analysis API** to production.

**Steps:**

1. Train a small NLP model locally.
2. Containerize it with Docker.
3. Deploy via FastAPI to AWS EC2 or Render.
4. Add a GitHub Action for CI/CD.
5. Track versions and logs using MLflow.

**Expected Outcome:**
A production-grade ML microservice that automatically redeploys when a new model version is committed — **true continuous delivery for AI**.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how to implement a canary deployment strategy for a new model version using Kubernetes and MLflow.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Deployment isn’t the finish line — it’s **the start of the AI lifecycle**.
By combining CI/CD, model tracking, and scalable infrastructure, you turn prototypes into **living, evolving AI systems**.
