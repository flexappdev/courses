# 🧮 Lesson 84 — DataOps & Feature Engineering Pipelines

### *(ETL, Feature Stores, Data Versioning, Pipeline Automation)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #84*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **build, automate, and manage end-to-end data pipelines** that feed your AI systems — transforming raw data into **high-quality, reusable features** with proper versioning, validation, and governance.

This is where **AI meets data engineering** — the backbone of every scalable ML system.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**DataOps** is the practice of applying DevOps principles to data workflows — automating ingestion, cleaning, validation, and deployment.
**Feature Engineering Pipelines** transform raw data into **meaningful inputs** for models, stored in centralized repositories called **feature stores** for consistency across training and inference.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                       | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ETL / ELT**                 | Extract, Transform, Load — standard data ingestion and transformation flow.          |
| **Feature Engineering**       | Deriving new, informative attributes from raw data (e.g., ratios, aggregates).       |
| **Feature Store**             | Central hub to store, version, and serve features for training and online inference. |
| **Data Validation**           | Ensuring schema, range, and distribution checks before model training.               |
| **Data Versioning**           | Tracking changes in datasets (using DVC, Delta Lake, or LakeFS).                     |
| **Orchestration Pipelines**   | Automating data flows via Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster.                              |
| **Data Provenance**           | Full lineage tracking for traceability and compliance.                               |
| **Real-Time Feature Serving** | Stream-based features for online prediction (e.g., Kafka, Feast).                    |

## ⚙️ Example — Feature Pipeline with Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("raw_transactions.csv")
df["transaction_ratio"] = df["amount"] / (df["account_balance"] + 1)
df["avg_spend_7d"] = df.groupby("user_id")["amount"].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(7, min_periods=1).mean())
df.to_csv("features_v1.csv", index=False)
```

➡ A simple transformation pipeline producing reusable features for model input.

---

## ⚙️ Example — DataOps Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Raw Data Sources] --> B[ETL/ELT Processing]
B --> C[Feature Engineering]
C --> D[Feature Store (Offline/Online)]
D --> E[Model Training / Inference]
E --> F[Monitoring & Drift Detection]
```

➡ Each component is versioned, validated, and connected — ensuring data consistency from ingestion to inference.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Create an automated **feature pipeline for fraud detection.**

**Steps:**

1. Ingest transaction data from CSV or database.
2. Engineer rolling averages and ratios.
3. Validate features with Great Expectations.
4. Push to a Feast feature store.
5. Use in an online model API for real-time fraud scoring.

**Expected Outcome:**
A production-ready **feature pipeline** that ensures data consistency, freshness, and reproducibility across training and inference.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How can you use Feast and Airflow together to automate feature pipelines for both batch and real-time inference?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

**Bad data kills good models.**
DataOps ensures your features are **accurate, versioned, and consistent**, allowing ML teams to move fast *without breaking trust*.
