# 🧱 Lesson 89 — AI Security & Adversarial Robustness

### *(Model Attacks, Data Poisoning, Adversarial Defense, Secure ML)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #89*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **defend AI systems from adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model theft**, ensuring your ML applications are **resilient, trustworthy, and secure** under hostile conditions.

Security in AI isn’t optional — it’s mission-critical.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**AI Security** protects models, data, and pipelines from malicious manipulation or exploitation.
**Adversarial Robustness** focuses on defending against *intentionally crafted inputs* that cause the model to make wrong predictions.

Together, they ensure your AI systems remain **safe, private, and dependable**, even when under attack.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                     | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adversarial Examples**    | Slightly altered inputs designed to fool models (e.g., pixel-level perturbations). |
| **Data Poisoning**          | Attackers inject malicious data into training sets to bias model outcomes.         |
| **Model Inversion**         | Infers sensitive information about the training data from model outputs.           |
| **Model Stealing**          | Replicating a model’s behavior by querying it extensively.                         |
| **Membership Inference**    | Determines whether a particular record was used during training.                   |
| **Evasion Attacks**         | Adversarial inputs crafted to bypass detection systems.                            |
| **Robust Training**         | Training models on perturbed data to improve resistance.                           |
| **Secure Model Deployment** | Encrypting models and APIs to prevent theft or tampering.                          |

## ⚙️ Example — Generating Adversarial Samples (FGSM Attack)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def fgsm_attack(model, data, labels, epsilon):
    data.requires_grad = True
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = F.nll_loss(outputs, labels)
    model.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    data_grad = data.grad.data
    perturbed = data + epsilon * data_grad.sign()
    return torch.clamp(perturbed, 0, 1)
```

➡ Creates adversarially perturbed images to test model robustness.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Create a **robust image classification model** resilient to adversarial attacks.

**Steps:**

1. Train a CNN on MNIST or CIFAR-10.
2. Generate FGSM and PGD attacks with ART or Foolbox.
3. Retrain using adversarial training to improve defense.
4. Measure robustness via accuracy drop under attack.

**Expected Outcome:**
A hardened AI model with documented defense metrics — demonstrating measurable robustness under adversarial conditions.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Simulate a model inversion attack on a public API and explain three techniques to defend against it.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

AI systems are only as strong as their defenses.
Adversarial robustness ensures your models stay **secure, explainable, and reliable** — even when the world gets hostile.
