# ‚òÅÔ∏è Lesson 61 ‚Äî AI Infrastructure & Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud)

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 ‚Äî Skill #61*

---

## üéØ Objective

Understand how to **build, scale, and manage AI workloads** across major **cloud platforms** ‚Äî AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud ‚Äî including compute, storage, GPU acceleration, and managed AI services.

---

## üß© Definition

**AI Infrastructure** is the backbone that powers data processing, model training, and inference at scale.
It includes cloud compute (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), data storage, networking, and managed AI tools.
Choosing the right platform and architecture can reduce costs, improve performance, and accelerate deployment cycles.

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept                                | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute Instances**                  | Virtual machines with CPUs/GPUs for AI workloads.                 |
| **GPUs/TPUs**                          | Specialized hardware for training deep neural networks.           |
| **Storage Layers**                     | Object (S3, Blob), block, and file storage for datasets/models.   |
| **Networking**                         | VPCs, load balancers, and secure endpoints for APIs.              |
| **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** | Controls access to cloud resources.                               |
| **Managed AI Services**                | Prebuilt ML pipelines, model hosting, and APIs.                   |
| **Auto-scaling**                       | Dynamically adjusts compute capacity to match workload.           |
| **Billing Optimization**               | Managing spot instances, reserved capacity, and usage monitoring. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example ‚Äî Deploying a Model on AWS EC2

```bash
# 1. Launch EC2 instance with GPU (e.g., g5.xlarge)
# 2. SSH into the instance
ssh -i "mykey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xx.compute.amazonaws.com

# 3. Install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip
pip install fastapi uvicorn torch transformers

# 4. Run FastAPI model server
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Access via `http://<public_ip>:8000/predict`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example ‚Äî Using Google Vertex AI for Training

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

aiplatform.init(project="my-ai-project", location="us-central1")

job = aiplatform.CustomJob(
    display_name="text-classification-training",
    worker_pool_specs=[{
        "machine_spec": {"machine_type": "n1-standard-8", "accelerator_type": "NVIDIA_TESLA_T4", "accelerator_count": 1},
        "replica_count": 1,
        "python_package_spec": {
            "executor_image_uri": "us-docker.pkg.dev/vertex-ai/training/tensorflow:2.11",
            "package_uris": ["gs://my_bucket/training_code.tar.gz"],
            "python_module": "trainer.task",
        },
    }]
)
job.run(sync=True)
```

## üìò Mini Project

**Goal:** Deploy a **Cross-Cloud Model Training + Inference Pipeline**
**Steps:**

1. Train on **GCP Vertex AI (TPU)**.
2. Store model on **AWS S3**.
3. Deploy inference API using **Azure ML endpoint**.
4. Monitor performance via centralized dashboard (e.g., Weights & Biases).

**Expected Outcome:**
A hybrid, cloud-agnostic AI architecture optimized for cost, performance, and reliability.
