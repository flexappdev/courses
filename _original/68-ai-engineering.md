# 🛡️ Lesson 68 — Privacy, Security & Responsible AI

### *(Differential Privacy, Model Attacks, Governance)*

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #68*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **design AI systems that protect user data, resist adversarial attacks, and comply with governance standards** — ensuring ethical, transparent, and trustworthy AI deployment.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Responsible AI** integrates principles of **privacy, security, fairness, and accountability** into every stage of the ML lifecycle.
It ensures models are not only performant but also **safe, compliant, and aligned with human values**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                               | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Differential Privacy (DP)**         | Adds statistical noise to data or gradients to protect individual information. |
| **Federated Learning (FL)**           | Trains models across distributed devices without sharing raw data.             |
| **Adversarial Attacks**               | Inputs crafted to fool models (e.g., image perturbations).                     |
| **Membership Inference Attack (MIA)** | Determining if specific data was part of training.                             |
| **Model Inversion**                   | Reconstructing private data from model outputs.                                |
| **Data Governance**                   | Ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, ISO/AI Act standards.                     |
| **Explainability (XAI)**              | Making model decisions interpretable.                                          |
| **Ethical AI Principles**             | Fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, and privacy.                   |

## ⚙️ Example — Differential Privacy in PyTorch

```python
from opacus import PrivacyEngine
from torch import nn, optim

model = nn.Linear(100, 10)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(model, batch_size=64, sample_size=50000, noise_multiplier=1.2, max_grad_norm=1.0)
privacy_engine.attach(optimizer)
```

➡ Ensures gradients are clipped and noise-added to achieve ε-differential privacy.

---

## ⚙️ Example — Federated Learning Simulation (Flower Framework)

```python
import flwr as fl

def get_parameters(model): return [val.cpu().numpy() for _, val in model.state_dict().items()]
def set_parameters(model, parameters): ...

fl.server.start_server(config=fl.server.ServerConfig(num_rounds=3))
fl.client.start_numpy_client(server_address="localhost:8080", client=MyClient())
```

➡ Trains models across distributed clients without centralizing raw data.

---

## ⚙️ Example — Explainable AI with SHAP

```python
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, data)
shap_values = explainer(data)
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
```

➡ Visualizes how each feature contributes to a model’s prediction.

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Implement a **Privacy-Preserving Sentiment Classifier**
**Steps:**

1. Train a BERT sentiment classifier.
2. Add differential privacy via Opacus.
3. Use SHAP or LIME to explain top contributing tokens.
4. Document model risk and fairness metrics.

**Expected Outcome:**
A transparent, privacy-preserving model demonstrating responsible AI best practices.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “How does differential privacy differ from federated learning in protecting user data?”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Responsible AI is not optional — it’s **the foundation of trust**.
Building privacy, fairness, and transparency into your models ensures long-term safety, compliance, and user confidence.
