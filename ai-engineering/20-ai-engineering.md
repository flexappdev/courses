# ⚙️ Lesson 20 — Transformers Architecture

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #20*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand the **Transformer architecture** — the foundation of modern AI systems like GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral — and how it revolutionized machine learning through **attention mechanisms**.

---

## 🧩 Definition

The **Transformer** is a deep learning architecture introduced in 2017 (“Attention Is All You Need”) that processes input sequences **in parallel** instead of sequentially (like RNNs).
Its key innovation — the **self-attention mechanism** — allows models to understand relationships between all tokens in a sequence simultaneously, enabling massive scalability and contextual understanding.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tokenization**         | Converts text into numerical tokens.                       |
| **Embeddings**           | Vector representations capturing semantic meaning.         |
| **Self-Attention**       | Allows each token to focus on other relevant tokens.       |
| **Multi-Head Attention** | Multiple attention layers capturing diverse relationships. |
| **Positional Encoding**  | Adds sequence order information to tokens.                 |
| **Feedforward Layers**   | Non-linear transformations after attention.                |
| **Residual Connections** | Prevent information loss during deep stacking.             |
| **Layer Normalization**  | Stabilizes training for large models.                      |

## ⚙️ Simplified Transformer Block (Pseudocode)

```python
def transformer_block(x):
    # Self-Attention
    attn_output = MultiHeadAttention(x, x, x)
    x = LayerNorm(x + attn_output)

    # Feedforward Network
    ff_output = FeedForward(x)
    x = LayerNorm(x + ff_output)

    return x
```

## 🧱 Encoder vs Decoder

| Component                  | Role                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encoder**                | Processes input sequences and creates contextual representations.  |
| **Decoder**                | Generates outputs token by token (used in GPT, translation, etc.). |
| **Encoder-Decoder Models** | Used for tasks like translation (e.g., T5, BERT2BERT).             |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Visualize **Self-Attention Weights**
**Steps:**

1. Load a pretrained model (e.g., BERT or DistilBERT from Hugging Face).
2. Tokenize a short sentence (“AI changes everything”).
3. Extract and plot attention matrices using `transformers` library.
4. Observe which words attend to which.

**Expected Outcome:**
A heatmap showing token-to-token attention — visual proof of how Transformers “think.”

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how the self-attention mechanism allows Transformers to outperform RNNs in natural language tasks.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Transformers are the **core engine of modern AI** — enabling parallel processing, long-range context, and scalability that power today’s LLMs.
