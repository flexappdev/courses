# 🔢 Lesson 7 — Linear Algebra

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #7*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand the **mathematical language of machine learning** — how data, weights, and model transformations are represented and computed using vectors and matrices.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Linear Algebra** is the branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.
Every ML/DL model — from logistic regression to GPT-5 — is built on these operations at scale, often optimized on GPUs.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                                 | Description                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Tensors** | Fundamental data representations in ML.       |
| **Matrix Operations**                   | Addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse. |
| **Dot Product**                         | Measures similarity between two vectors.      |
| **Matrix Multiplication**               | Foundation of neural network layers.          |
| **Determinant & Inverse**               | Properties of linear systems.                 |
| **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**          | Reveal directions of maximum variance.        |
| **Rank & Span**                         | Dimensionality of vector spaces.              |
| **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  | Used in PCA and dimensionality reduction.     |

## 🧮 Example Formulas

```text
Dot Product: a · b = Σ (aᵢ × bᵢ)
Matrix Multiplication: C = A × B
Norm (Length): ||v|| = √(Σ vᵢ²)
```

---

## ⚙️ Python Example

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[2, 0], [1, 3]])

# Matrix multiplication
C = np.dot(A, B)

# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
e_vals, e_vecs = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("A × B =", C)
print("Eigenvalues:", e_vals)
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Linear Transformation Visualizer**
**Steps:**

1. Generate random 2D vectors using NumPy.
2. Apply different transformation matrices (rotation, scaling).
3. Visualize before/after with Matplotlib.
4. Explain the geometric meaning of each transformation.

**Expected Outcome:**
An interactive notebook showing how linear algebra transforms data — the same way neural layers do.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how matrix multiplication represents connections between layers in a neural network.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Linear Algebra is the **engine room of AI math** — enabling every vectorized computation from embeddings to transformer attention.
