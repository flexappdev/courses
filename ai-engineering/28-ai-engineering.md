# 🤗 Lesson 28 — Hugging Face Models Hub

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #28*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **find, use, fine-tune, and share AI models** using the **Hugging Face Hub** — the world’s largest open-source platform for NLP, vision, and multimodal models.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Hugging Face** is an open-source ecosystem that hosts thousands of **pre-trained models, datasets, and pipelines** for AI tasks.
It provides powerful libraries like `transformers`, `datasets`, and `accelerate` that make model experimentation, deployment, and collaboration effortless.

## ⚙️ Example — Using a Pre-Trained Model

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
print(generator("Artificial intelligence is transforming", max_length=30))
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Loading from the Hub

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

inputs = tokenizer("AI is awesome!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs.logits)
```
