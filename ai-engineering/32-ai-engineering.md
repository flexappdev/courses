# ⚙️ Lesson 32 — MLOps Fundamentals

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #32*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn the fundamentals of **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** — the discipline that brings DevOps best practices to AI systems, ensuring **reliable training, deployment, monitoring, and scaling** of machine learning models.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**MLOps** is a set of tools, processes, and cultural practices for **managing the entire ML lifecycle** — from data collection and model training to deployment and monitoring.
Its goal is to **automate and standardize** how models move from development to production.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI/CD for ML**         | Automating model testing, retraining, and redeployment. |
| **Model Registry**       | Central repository for storing versioned models.        |
| **Experiment Tracking**  | Log metrics, parameters, and results (e.g., MLflow).    |
| **Data Versioning**      | Manage dataset changes using tools like DVC.            |
| **Model Serving**        | Deploy and scale trained models via APIs or endpoints.  |
| **Monitoring**           | Track drift, latency, and prediction errors.            |
| **Retraining Pipelines** | Schedule automated retraining with fresh data.          |
| **Reproducibility**      | Ensure consistent results across environments.          |

## ⚙️ Example — MLOps with MLflow

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
    
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

## ⚙️ Example — CI/CD Pipeline (YAML Snippet)

```yaml
name: MLOps CI/CD
on: [push]
jobs:
  train_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Train model
        run: python train.py
      - name: Deploy model
        run: python deploy.py
```

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Mini MLOps Pipeline**
**Steps:**

1. Train a simple classification model.
2. Log metrics and model artifacts in MLflow.
3. Store dataset versions using DVC.
4. Automate retraining via GitHub Actions.

**Expected Outcome:**
A fully versioned, reproducible ML workflow with automatic retraining and deployment.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how MLOps improves the reliability and reproducibility of AI model deployment.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

MLOps is the **glue between AI and production** — automating and scaling the entire lifecycle so models stay accurate, reliable, and continuously improving.
