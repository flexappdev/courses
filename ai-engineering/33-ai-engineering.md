# 🛰️ Lesson 33 — Model Monitoring & Drift Detection

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #33*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **track your AI models in production**, detect when their performance degrades, and respond to **data or concept drift** — ensuring ongoing accuracy and reliability.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Model Monitoring** involves observing your deployed AI systems to detect issues such as **model decay**, **bias**, or **unexpected data changes**.
**Drift Detection** identifies when new input data no longer matches the training distribution — a key reason models fail silently in production.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                 | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Drift**          | The statistical properties of input data change over time.         |
| **Concept Drift**       | The relationship between input features and target output changes. |
| **Performance Decay**   | Drop in metrics such as accuracy or F1-score.                      |
| **Monitoring Metrics**  | Latency, error rate, prediction confidence.                        |
| **Alerts & Thresholds** | Trigger notifications when performance drops.                      |
| **Shadow Deployment**   | Compare new model vs current one without serving users.            |
| **Feedback Loop**       | Collect real outcomes to retrain and improve models.               |

## ⚙️ Example — Drift Detection with `EvidentlyAI`

```python
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metrics import DataDriftPreset

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=train_df, current_data=prod_df)
report.show(mode="inline")
```

This generates a visual drift report comparing training vs production data distributions.

---

## ⚙️ Example — Real-Time Monitoring Setup

```python
import prometheus_client as prom

# Track inference metrics
INFERENCE_TIME = prom.Summary('inference_time_seconds', 'Time per prediction')
REQUEST_COUNT = prom.Counter('request_count', 'Number of requests served')

@INFERENCE_TIME.time()
def predict(data):
    # model inference logic here
    return model.predict(data)
```

## 🧱 Common Monitoring Tools

| Purpose                   | Tools                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Drift Detection**       | EvidentlyAI, WhyLabs, Fiddler               |
| **Performance Tracking**  | MLflow, Arize AI                            |
| **Metrics Visualization** | Grafana, Prometheus                         |
| **Alerting**              | Slack, PagerDuty integrations               |
| **Logging**               | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Model Drift Dashboard**
**Steps:**

1. Train a model and save baseline metrics.
2. Simulate new “drifted” production data.
3. Use EvidentlyAI to generate a drift report.
4. Serve results in Grafana via Prometheus metrics.

**Expected Outcome:**
An automated dashboard detecting when input data or predictions deviate from expected behavior.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain the difference between data drift and concept drift and how each impacts AI model performance.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Monitoring ensures your models stay **alive and trustworthy** — catching silent failures early before they cause business or ethical issues.
