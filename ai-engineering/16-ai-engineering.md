# 💬 Lesson 16 — Prompt Engineering Basics

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #16*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to **craft effective prompts** that control, guide, and optimize the responses of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude, or Gemini.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of designing precise and structured inputs (prompts) that steer AI models toward the desired output.
For AI engineers, it’s a skill that bridges **human intent** and **model reasoning** — turning vague requests into consistent, high-quality results.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                    | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prompt Format**          | Structure your input clearly: context → instruction → example → question.      |
| **System vs User Prompts** | Use system messages to set rules or persona, user messages to provide queries. |
| **Few-Shot Learning**      | Give examples to guide model behavior.                                         |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Encourage the model to reason step-by-step.                                    |
| **Zero-Shot Prompting**    | Ask directly without examples.                                                 |
| **Role Prompting**         | Tell the model who it is (“You are an AI teacher…”).                           |
| **Prompt Templates**       | Reusable structured prompts for repeated tasks.                                |
| **Evaluation & Iteration** | Test and refine prompts to improve reliability.                                |

Explain in 3 concise bullet points why FastAPI is good for model deployment.
```

**Few-Shot Example**

```text
Translate the following sentences to Spanish:

Input: "Good morning"  
Output: "Buenos días"

Input: "How are you?"  
Output:
```

## 🧱 Tools for Prompt Engineering

| Tool                        | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI Playground**       | Experiment with prompts interactively.   |
| **LangChain / LlamaIndex**  | Build prompt chains and context systems. |
| **PromptLayer / PromptHub** | Track and version your prompts.          |
| **Guardrails.ai**           | Add safety and formatting validation.    |
| **Anthropic Console**       | Test structured prompts with Claude.     |

---

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Prompt Testing Notebook**
**Steps:**

1. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI key.
2. Write a Python script that takes a prompt and returns the response.
3. Add few-shot examples and compare outputs.
4. Log prompt + response pairs in a CSV.

**Expected Outcome:**
A simple framework to test, refine, and compare prompts for any LLM task.

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Design a prompt that makes GPT-5 act as a career coach for software engineers.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Prompt Engineering is the **new programming layer of AI** — the language through which humans shape model intelligence and behavior.
