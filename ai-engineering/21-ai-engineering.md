# 🧩 Lesson 21 — Embeddings Concepts

### *AI Engineer Roadmap 2025 — Skill #21*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how **embeddings** convert text, images, or audio into **numerical vectors** that represent meaning — the foundation of search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

---

## 🧩 Definition

An **embedding** is a numerical representation (vector) of an object — like a word, sentence, or image — in a high-dimensional space.
Similar items are placed **closer together**, enabling machines to understand relationships such as *“king – man + woman ≈ queen.”*

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                   | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vector Space**          | Continuous space where semantic meaning is captured numerically. |
| **Dimensionality**        | Number of numerical features in an embedding (e.g., 768, 1536).  |
| **Cosine Similarity**     | Measures angle (closeness) between vectors.                      |
| **Dot Product**           | Alternative metric for vector similarity.                        |
| **Word Embeddings**       | Representations of words (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).                |
| **Sentence Embeddings**   | Context-aware vectors (e.g., SBERT, OpenAI embeddings).          |
| **Multimodal Embeddings** | Combine modalities (e.g., CLIP for text + image).                |
| **Embedding Drift**       | When model updates change vector meaning — requires re-indexing. |

## ⚙️ Example — Text Embeddings via OpenAI API

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input="Artificial Intelligence connects ideas and data."
)

vector = response.data[0].embedding
print(f"Embedding length: {len(vector)} | First 5 dims: {vector[:5]}")
```

---

## ⚙️ Example — Cosine Similarity

```python
from numpy import dot
from numpy.linalg import norm

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    return dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))
```

## 🧱 Use Cases in AI Engineering

| Area                             | Example                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Semantic Search**              | Find similar meanings rather than keywords.  |
| **Recommendation Systems**       | Suggest similar products or content.         |
| **RAG Pipelines**                | Retrieve contextual chunks for LLMs.         |
| **Clustering / Categorization**  | Group related items by meaning.              |
| **Plagiarism & Fraud Detection** | Detect semantic duplicates.                  |
| **Knowledge Graphs**             | Represent entities and relations as vectors. |

## 📘 Mini Project

**Goal:** Build a **Semantic Search Engine**
**Steps:**

1. Generate embeddings for 100 text documents.
2. Store them in a vector database (FAISS or Pinecone).
3. Input a search query and find top 5 most similar results.
4. Display ranked results with similarity scores.

**Expected Outcome:**
A local semantic search system that retrieves meaning-based matches instead of simple keyword ones.

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

> “Explain how embeddings differ from traditional keyword matching in information retrieval.”

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway

Embeddings are the **semantic glue** of AI — allowing models to connect, compare, and reason about meaning across vast amounts of data.
