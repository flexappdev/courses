# English Teacher

## Product
English Teacher is a content production toolkit for building business-focused English courses. Educators can outline an eight-session syllabus and automatically produce consistent lesson assets for every session. The repo includes reference topics such as **Customer and distribution** and **Marketing and advertising**, each designed with eight sessions and eight slides per session so learners gain repeated practice across vocabulary, analysis, and presentation skills.

## UX
Course builders work through a predictable set of deliverables. Markdown drafts live in `_original/`, JSON handoffs populate `json/`, and slide decks render in `slides/`. Helper scripts (`main.py`, `slides.py`, and `doc.py`) keep the workflow command-line friendlyâ€”run them from the project root to preview console output or regenerate artifacts once new content is ready. Prompts inside the repository guide how to brief the DOCAI assistant when fresh course sessions or slide scripts are needed.

## Tech
The project is written in Python and leans on small utilities in `dev/`:
- `courses_json.py` converts structured Markdown into JSON objects using `python-slugify` for stable identifiers.
- `courses_update.py` and `courses_slides.py` prepare course data for downstream consumers, including Swiper and Google Slides integrations.
- `courses_google_slides.py` connects to the Google Slides API to build presentations programmatically.
Supporting scripts share configuration for input/output folders so assets land in predictable directories alongside the source files.

## Flow
1. Outline a course session in Markdown, following the eight-section template (Introduction, four numbered topics, Conclusion, Next steps, and Extra slide).
2. Use the DOCAI assistant to expand the outline into a fully populated CSV/JSON structure with titles, subtitles, intros, key ideas, and examples for every slide.
3. Convert Markdown or CSV drafts into JSON with `python3 main.py` or call `python3 doc.py` to refresh documentation-oriented outputs.
4. Generate presentation decks through `python3 slides.py`, or trigger the Google Slides workflow when a connected account is available.
5. Review the produced materials, update objectives or transitions as needed, and iterate until each session meets the target learning outcomes.

## Marketing
Position English Teacher as an accelerator for bilingual business programs. Highlight how automated slide scripts, consistent lesson templates, and branded prompts reduce prep time while keeping instruction aligned with professional use cases (e.g., Nike or Apple storytelling). Emphasize smooth slide transitions, clearly stated objectives, and concrete case studies so stakeholders see both pedagogical rigor and marketing polish.
