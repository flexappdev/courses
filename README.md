**Prompt for chatGPT**  
Based on my presentation, provide a script for each of the slides in the following format: introduction sentence to each slide, develop each key idea within each slide with introduction sentence, one sentence explanation and one example. Also, provide an introduction and a conclusion in a few sentences to the presentation. Finally, in slide 7 “next steps”, provide with a short case study as per the format attached (as per the presentation). Further, use transition words between slides, in particular at the introduction and conclusion. When providing an example for each of the key idea use concrete brands such as Nike or Apple. 

**Questions/ comments**

* Why do we have an extra slide (slide 8): best if we remove it (to avoid confusion), or put it after slide 5\.  
* State clearly objective for each session  
* In conclusion, did students meet the objective of the session? did they understand the session?  
* Make transitions between slides so it goes smoothly, so there’s a logic when presenting the slides  
* Avoid redundancy, do not repeat the same information within one session  
* Definition of key concepts would be helpful

**Example of Script from chatGPT**  
Below is a test script, I simply send the presentation to chatGPT and asked for a script.
