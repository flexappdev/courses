Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. Different approaches include supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding hidden patterns), and reinforcement learning (trial-and-error learning with feedback). ML powers many applications, such as spam filters, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, making it one of the most widely used AI technologies.",
