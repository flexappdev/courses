It introduced the concept of attention — allowing models to focus on the most relevant parts of data sequences. Unlike RNNs or CNNs, Transformers process information in parallel, achieving state-of-the-art performance in language, vision, and multimodal AI. This course explores how Transformers work, their components, training principles, and their impact on modern AI systems.",
