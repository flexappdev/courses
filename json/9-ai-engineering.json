It provides a structured way to organize code into classes and objects that mirror real-world entities and relationships. This course introduces the four pillars of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism—and demonstrates how they can be applied to AI project architectures, model development, and data pipelines.",
